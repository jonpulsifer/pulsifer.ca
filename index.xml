You can read about it over on the Google Cloud Blog, too!
No more exporting Google service account keys or lumping permissions onto one account. Kubernetes now provides a way for Kubernetes workloads to prove their identity outside of their cluster. We‚Äôve built on this to deliver a simpler, more secure way to authenticate to Google services whether you‚Äôre running Kubernetes on GKE, GCP, on-premises, or a hybrid mix.</description></item><item><title>Securing the Software Supply Chain</title><link>/talks/secure-software-supply-chain-binauthz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/secure-software-supply-chain-binauthz/</guid><description>This is a talk Jianing Guo and I gave at Google Cloud Next 2018 about securing software supply chains with Binary Authorization. I showed off the tool my team developed called Voucher which we later donated to the Grafeas organization.
I also wrote about this over on shopify.engineering.
Containers have revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications. As enterprises create more containerized workloads, the security of the software supply chain must be top of mind.</description></item><item><title>Securing Shopify's PaaS on GKE</title><link>/talks/securing-the-paas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/securing-the-paas/</guid><description>This is a talk I gave at SecTor, as well as at KubeCon the following month!
Shopify has leveraged Kubernetes through Google Container Engine (GKE) to build its new cloud platform. This PaaS is currently serving the majority of the company&amp;rsquo;s internal tools as well as business-critical production workloads. Moving to Kubernetes and a public cloud is no easy task, especially for a security team.
Unfortunately for us, a hosted solution does not offer all the features we&amp;rsquo;ve come to love in Kubernetes including NetworkPolicies, PodSecurityPolicies, and admission controllers among others.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Security 2.0</title><link>/talks/infrastructure-security-2-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/infrastructure-security-2-0/</guid><description>Shopify has leveraged Kubernetes through Google Container Engine (GKE) to build its new cloud platform.

Given industry&amp;rsquo;s limited experience with cloud computing and cloud native technologies, this talk hopes to demystify some of these core cloud concepts.</description></item><item><title>CEVO Client Information Disclosure</title><link>/posts/cevo-information-disclosure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cevo-information-disclosure/</guid><description>tl;dr CEVO was a global eSports company built around North America‚Äôs largest competitive online PC gaming league. The CEVO client is software that is mandatory to be run during online play. The client was transmitting user authentication details (usernames and passwords) and private conversations in clear text which made them susceptible to eavesdropping attacks.
Good day CS:GO friends!
