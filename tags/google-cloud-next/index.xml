You can read about it over on the Google Cloud Blog, too!
No more exporting Google service account keys or lumping permissions onto one account. Kubernetes now provides a way for Kubernetes workloads to prove their identity outside of their cluster. We’ve built on this to deliver a simpler, more secure way to authenticate to Google services whether you’re running Kubernetes on GKE, GCP, on-premises, or a hybrid mix.</description></item><item><title>Securing the Software Supply Chain</title><link>/talks/secure-software-supply-chain-binauthz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/secure-software-supply-chain-binauthz/</guid><description>This is a talk Jianing Guo and I gave at Google Cloud Next 2018 about securing software supply chains with Binary Authorization. I showed off the tool my team developed called Voucher which we later donated to the Grafeas organization.
I also wrote about this over on shopify.engineering.
Containers have revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications. As enterprises create more containerized workloads, the security of the software supply chain must be top of mind.</description></item></channel></rss>
