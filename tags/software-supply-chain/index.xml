I showed off the tool my team developed called &lt;a href="https://github.com/grafeas/voucher">Voucher&lt;/a> which we later donated to the &lt;a href="https://grafeas.io/">Grafeas&lt;/a> organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also wrote about this over on &lt;a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-governs-containers-at-scale-with-grafeas-and-kritis">shopify.engineering&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Containers have revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications. As enterprises create more containerized workloads, the security of the software supply chain must be top of mind. Join this session to learn how security teams can enhance deploy-security security. Weâ€™ll also hear from the security team at Shopify to learn how they use GCP tools as part of their container security strategy and best practices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Security 2.0</title><link>/talks/infrastructure-security-2-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/infrastructure-security-2-0/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>Shopify has leveraged Kubernetes through Google Container Engine (GKE) to build its new cloud platform. This PaaS is currently serving the majority of the company&amp;rsquo;s internal tools as well as business-critical production workloads. Moving to Kubernetes and a public cloud is no easy task, especially for a security team.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
