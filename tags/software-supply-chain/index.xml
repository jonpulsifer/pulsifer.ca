I showed off the tool my team developed called Voucher which we later donated to the Grafeas organization.
I also wrote about this over on shopify.engineering.
Containers have revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications. As enterprises create more containerized workloads, the security of the software supply chain must be top of mind.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Security 2.0</title><link>/talks/infrastructure-security-2-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/infrastructure-security-2-0/</guid><description>Shopify has leveraged Kubernetes through Google Container Engine (GKE) to build its new cloud platform. This PaaS is currently serving the majority of the company&amp;rsquo;s internal tools as well as business-critical production workloads. Moving to Kubernetes and a public cloud is no easy task, especially for a security team.
Given industry&amp;rsquo;s limited experience with cloud computing and cloud native technologies, this talk hopes to demystify some of these core cloud concepts.</description></item></channel></rss>
