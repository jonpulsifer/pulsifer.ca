&lt;p>CEVO was a global eSports company built around North Americaâ€™s largest competitive online PC gaming league. The CEVO client is software that is mandatory to be run during online play. The client was transmitting user authentication details (usernames and passwords) and private conversations in clear text which made them susceptible to eavesdropping attacks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Good day CS:GO friends!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reference: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2wl8qz/warning_esea_shows_complete_disregard_for_your/">/r/globaloffensive post&lt;/a> about &lt;a href="https://play.esea.net">ESEA&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s password security from early spring 2015.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a couple of the guys over this weekend to play some video games and of course CS:GO was on our list. We decided to download the &lt;a href="https://cevo.com">CEVO&lt;/a> client because of the cost of ESEA and our skill differences in matchmaking. I recalled a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2wl8qz/warning_esea_shows_complete_disregard_for_your/">Reddit post&lt;/a> from this spring and decided to double check that CEVO would at least take the lessons learned from the attacks on ESEA and secure their users. I was wrong!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
