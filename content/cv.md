#### Lead Instructor - Computer Network Defence Analyst, 2012-2015

Employed as lead developer and instructor for the Computer Network Defence Analyst (CNDA) course. The four week CNDA course was created in order to provide basic level knowledge and skills required to be employed as a network analyst in the conduct of Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO). The CNDA course is comprised of two main sections.

The first section is intended to provide a fundamental understanding of the cyber environment in which the analyst operates and tools of the trade. The second section shifts focus to introduce students to the tradecraft of traffic analysis that enables the analyst to understand and identify when and how a given security posture has been compromised.
