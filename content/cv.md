### CEVO Client Information Disclosure Vulnerability

CEVO was a global eSports company built around North America’s largest competitive online PC gaming league. Founded in December of 2004 with the intention to transform competitive online gaming into a professional sport, CEVO has been hosting both free and pay-to-pay tournaments across a variety of AAA titles for over 10 years. The CEVO client is software that is mandatory to be run during online play. The client was transmitting user authentication details (usernames and passwords) in clear text which made them susceptible to eavesdropping attacks.
