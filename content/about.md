Greetings. I'm **@jonpulsifer**, welcome to my personal website -- I built it myself! :joy:

For my last `$dayjob`, I was a [Staff Security Engineer][1] working on Kubernetes :blue_heart: at [Shopify](https://shopify.ca).

:raised_hand: I am **open for employment!** Please take a look at [my resume]({{< relref "/cv" >}}) and if you think I might be a good fit, email [jonathan@pulsifer.ca](mailto:jonathan@pulsifer.ca) or contact me using one of the social icons at the bottom.

**PGP:** `0x0472D3B3F5012430`
