Greetings. I'm **@jonpulsifer**, welcome to my cyber zen garden.

I'm currently the Engineering Manager for [MoonPay's](https://moonpay.com) [Site Reliability Engineering][2] and [Cloud Security][3] teams.

Before that, I was a [Staff Security Engineer][1] working on Kubernetes :blue_heart: at [Shopify](https://shopify.ca).

:raised_hand: I am **not** open for employment. You can still take a look at [my resume]({{< relref "/cv" >}}) and if you think I might be a good fit, email [jonathan@pulsifer.ca](mailto:jonathan@pulsifer.ca) or contact me using one of the social icons at the bottom... but don't get your hopes up :smile:

**PGP:** `0x0472D3B3F5012430`
